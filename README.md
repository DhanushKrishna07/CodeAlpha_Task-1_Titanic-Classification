Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more

 ðŸš¢Titanic ClassificationðŸŒŠ
 
Developed a comprehensive machine learning model to predict Titanic passengers' survival based on socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. Analyzed various classification algorithms to determine the most effective predictor of survival.

Project Highlights:

â€¢Explored Various Machine Learning Models: Evaluated multiple models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and xgBoost.
â€¢Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize the Gradient Boosting Classifier, enhancing model performance.
â€¢Visual Data Analysis: Generated insightful visualizations to understand the impact of different features on survival.
â€¢Performance Metrics Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Steps Involved:

â€¢Importing Libraries: Loaded essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
â€¢Data Reading and Cleaning: Imported the Titanic dataset, handled missing values, and performed data cleaning.
â€¢Data Visualization: Created various visualizations to understand the distribution and impact of different features on survival.
â€¢Feature Encoding: Encoded categorical variables like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' for model training.
â€¢Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model evaluation.
â€¢Model Training and Evaluation: Trained several classification models and evaluated their performance using validation data.
â€¢Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted hyperparameter tuning on the best-performing model using GridSearchCV.
â€¢Final Model Evaluation: Assessed the optimized model on the test dataset to ensure its generalizability to unseen data.
â€¢Visualization of Results: Visualized the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance in detail.

Key Takeaway:

Successfully built a robust machine learning model to predict the survival of Titanic passengers, demonstrating the importance of feature analysis, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning in developing accurate predictive models.
